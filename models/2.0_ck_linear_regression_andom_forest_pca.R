##### THIS IS A **SUMMARY** OF ALL THE MODELS I TRIED #####
# The goal is to compare the predictions from Linear model vs Random Forest 
# and make a case for linear regression. This is why in this R document
# I am doing prediction for the training set and looking at error rate
# I added the Kaggle score for the test set as an indicator too.

##### USING LINEAR REGRESSION #####
### ONLY LOOKING AT BEST MODEL FOR LINEAR REGRESSION
# Below is a list of all the different strategy used with linear regression that did not perform as well:
# 1- Linear Regression with feature engineering - SCORE ON KAGGLE:0.39105
# 2- Linear Regression after doing PCA (PCA is described at the very bottom for the curious) - SCORE ON KAGGLE: 0.38651
# 3- Linear Regression with more variables - SCORE ON KAGGLE: 0.40140

# predicting on test data using the PCs we uncovered 
# a few points to remember:
# 1- We can not combine the train and test set to obtain PCA components of whole data at once. 
# Because, this would violate the entire assumption of generalization since test data would get ‘leaked’ into the training set. 
# 2- We can not perform PCA on test and train data sets separately. Because, the resultant vectors 
# from train and test PCAs will have different directions ( due to unequal variance). 
# Due to this, we’ll end up comparing data registered on different axes. 
# Therefore, the resulting vectors from train and test data should have same axes.

# So we need to do exactly the same transformation to the test set as we did to training set:
