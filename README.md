The goal of the Sberbank Russian Housing Market Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/sberbank-russian-housing-market) was to predict realty price fluctuations in Russia for Sherbank, Russiaâ€™s oldest and largest bank. Sherbank provided Kagglers with a rich dataset that included housing data and macroeconomic patterns (a total of 200 variables and 30,000 observations).
